This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) and shadcn-ui.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

then, to mock a rest api use json-server and point to the data.json on a different port than Next.js:

```bash
npm install -g json-server
# then
npx json-server --watch ./_data/db.json --port 4000
```
